Smoked Bacon Burgers:

1. Marinate the bacon with dry rub for at least 24 hours and let it rest in the refrigerator.

2. Weave the bacon around the burgers, creating a bacon lattice.

3. Smoke the bacon-wrapped burgers indirectly using applewood smoke, avoiding direct heat.

4. Prepare homemade pesto to be served on foil-wrapped potatoes. Cook the pesto-covered potatoes in aluminum foil on the BBQ while smoking the burgers.

5. Simultaneously, pre-smoke the ribs for tomorrow's cooking. Apply a thin layer of dry rub to the ribs.

Tomorrow, you can finish cooking the pre-smoked ribs for a flavorful meal.

Enjoy your delicious smoked bacon burgers, pesto-covered potatoes, and pre-smoked ribs!
