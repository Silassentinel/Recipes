Today's Menu:

- 30-hour dry-rub cured pork roast
- 4 hours of smoking with applewood
- Wrapped in bacon and smoked for an additional hour
- Resting for an hour in aluminum foil with fresh sage and extra rub spices on the bacon

I'm currently using the drippings to cook corn cobs.

Once those are ready, I'll prepare the BBQ sauce.

The BBQ sauce is made with apple cider, ketchup, blonde and brown sugar, honey, corn oil, salt, and a touch of rub spices.

The rub spice mix consists of:
- 2 parts sugar to 1 part salt
- 1/4 part paprika
- A small amount of chili flakes
